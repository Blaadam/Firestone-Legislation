# Cadet Anti-Discrimination Act

An Act<br/>
Cadets in FFA and POST are not enumerated the same protections as most individuals in the
State of Firestone when it comes to being subject to training programs by government agencies.
This problem has been brought to attention by several POST graduates, and this Act intends to
rectify these concerns..

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,

## §1. Title

(a) This act shall be known, and may be cited as, “Cadet Anti-Discrimination Act”

## §2. Enactment

(a) This Bill shall go into effect as an Act of Congress upon completing the processes
constitutionally required.

## §3. Severability

(a) Should any part of this Act be struck down and/or declared unenforceable, then that part
shall be severed with the rest remaining in full force and effect unless all is struck down and/or
declared unenforceable.

## §4. Enforcement

(a) This Act shall be enforced by any relevant parties.

## §5. Definitions

(a) “Cadet” shall be defined as anyone who is currently attending an academy or training program
offered by the Peace Officer Standards & Training or the Firestone Fire Academy

(b) “Director” shall be defined as the Director of the Peace officer Standards & Training or the
Firestone Fire Academy

(c) “Fairer Employment Act” shall be defined as Trello

## §6. Rights/Protections Defined

(a) It shall be the responsibility of the Directors to make a reasonable effort to ensure the rights
of their cadets are justly upheld.

(b) Cadets shall maintain the following rights:

<ul>
(b1) Cadets shall have the unquestionable right against and protection from discrimination
and/or bias by their instructor, or anyone with the ability to discipline said Cadets, on the basis
of race, gender, sex, sexual orientation, political affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, religion or
lack thereof, age (except where age should be limited by standing Terms of Service for any
platforms commonly used in the State of Firestone, i.e. Discord, and/or affect their ability to be
in the academy, i.e. through ROBLOX’s “safechat” system), unrelated personal matters, and/or
any other arbitrary measures judged to be unfairly discriminatory.<br/>

(b2) Breaches of the protections and rights enumerated in (b1) may be pursued in civil court.

</ul>

c) Should Peace Officer Standards & Training or the Firestone Fire Academy be found
guilty/liable of breaching the protections enumerated in (b1):

<ul>
(c1) The respective Director shall be required to rectify these concerns adequately. Whatever
the conditions of these rectifications are shall be determined by the Presiding Officer of that
case.
</ul>

## §7. Clarifications

This Act serves to fill in the gap that the Fairer Employment Act (FEA) left in regard to
POST/FFA cadets, where the FEA only covers departmental cadets. It is the belief that POST/FFA
cadets should be entitled to the same rights and protections as departmental cadets.
