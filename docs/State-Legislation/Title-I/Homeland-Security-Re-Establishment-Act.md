## §6. OPERATIONS, RESPONSIBILITIES, & JURISDICTION

a) The Firestone Department of Homeland Security shall have statewide authority to
enforce the statutes of Firestone, however, it shall have a primary focus on protecting
state infrastructure, government assets, and government officials. The Firestone
Department of Homeland Security shall not deviate from its primary focus unless they (1)
are requested by other law enforcement for a situation in which they are overwhelmed or
unable to adequately handle, or (2) witness, or are in the immediate vicinity of an active
crime that threatens life or property. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall maintain
specific policies in accordance with this.

b) The Firestone Department of Homeland Security shall have primary authority over any
situation or matter relating to critical government infrastructure, government officials, or
any individual actively under the protection of the FDHS unless otherwise specified by
the Governor or state law.

## §7. PROTECTION RESPONSIBILITIES, OPERATIONS & POWERS.

(a) The Firestone Department of Homeland Security shall be responsible for establishing and
maintaining a database of Government Officials who shall be entitled to protection by the
department, the database can either be by individual and/or Government Position. Individuals
who are entitled to protection by the department may waive protection at any time. The
following government positions shall be entitled to priority protection but may waive protection
at any time: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the House, Court Chief Justice.

<ul>
(a1) The list of Officials entitled to priority protection may be amended by the Secretary
of the Department of Homeland Security, however, nobody in the roles as specified by §7(a) may
be removed from the list of Officials entitled to priority protection.
</ul>
(b) Government Officials under the active protection of FDHS may be forcibly transported away
or into a location for their safety by FDHS without any agent involved being charged with any
crime that would conflict with this section. Government Officials under the active protection of
FDHS may also be followed and trailed by FDHS without FDHS facing any legal repercussions.
However, should the government official state they are waiving protection, FDHS shall not be
protected by this Section until such a time that the protection is requested again.

(c) Should an active protection operation on any official be taking place and said official is in a
public area, FDHS shall reserve the right to ‘lockdown’ property. Only the Detail Commander
may invoke this power. Other on-duty law enforcement may be restricted from entering the
property by the Detail Commander, without the Detail Commander committing a crime when this
power is invoked. This power may be invoked on private property, only with the consent of the
owner of the property. Access to the property which is locked down may be restricted within the
following parameters;

<ul>
  <li>
  The property being locked down is only being locked down to reasonably protect the
  official.
  </li>

  <li>
  The property being locked down is not majorly inhibiting the travel of the public.
  </li>

  <li>
  The property being locked down remains in this status for as little time as possible.
  </li>
</ul>

(d) The Firestone Department of Homeland Security or any department or unit assisting FDHS
shall reserve the right to request citizens' consent to a search and to show their name before
entering property that is locked down. FDHS may not force any citizen to consent to a search,
however, may deny them entry if they do not consent to a search. FDHS shall reserve the right to
deny any citizen with a weapon (legal or illegal) into an area that is locked down. For all intents
and purposes, any official being present on such property shall be an ‘emergency or threat’ as
described by Article 5 of the Constitution.

(e) FDHS may violate any and all traffic laws without penalty in the name of protecting an
official in an emergent situation where;

<ul>
  <li>
  There is a low chance of any citizen being injured because of traffic laws not being
  respected.
  </li>
  <li>
  here is a direct and immediate threat to an official being protected where using ELS or
  driving on conventional roads would greatly exacerbate the threat, or where utilizing
  Emergency Lighting System could pose a threat.
  </li>
</ul>

(f) FDHS may violate parking regulations without penalty in the name of protecting an official.
