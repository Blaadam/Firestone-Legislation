# The Administrative Leave Act

An Act Recognising the need for departments to safeguard the public in the early stages of an
investigation against an employee, this Act seeks to allow departments to place employees
under administrative leave, within the regulations set forth. This will resolve debates over
whether the issue amounts to a disciplinary action under law, allowing for employers to act
decisively in critical moments.<br/>
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,

## SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS

(a) The Fairer Employment Act shall be recognised as [Fairer Employment Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20240623024416/https://forums.stateoffirestone.com/t/fairer-employment-act/17505)

(b) “Administrative Leave” shall be defined as “A non-disciplinary action made by an
employer against an employee, temporarily suspending that employee’s duties, including
but not limited to prohibiting them from representing the employer.”

## SECTION 2: REGULATIONS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE

(a) A department may place an employee under Administrative Leave in order to allow for
the prompt and effective investigation of an allegation amounting to a breach of law or
severe policy violation.

(b) When determining what a severe policy violation is, departments - and the Courts if an
employee alleges they have been unlawfully placed under Administrative Leave - shall
consider the likelihood that the offence actually occurred, according to the evidence
available at the time of the initial decision, and the harm that arose/may have arose, if the
allegation is proven.

(c) No employee shall be placed under administrative leave for more than 21 days from the
date the allegation was made.

(d) No employee shall be placed under administrative leave if the allegation is in relation to
an incident that occurred more than 45 days before the allegation was brought to the
employer.

(e) If the allegation being investigated is found proven, any resulting disciplinary actions
must take into account the employee’s time on administrative leave.

## SECTION 3: AMENDING THE FAIRER EMPLOYMENT ACT
