## SECTION 1.

<sup>F1</sup> [(a) Statute of limitations” shall be defined as the set period after a crime(s),
infraction(s), or other legal wrongdoing(s) has been committed, after the expiry of which
no person shall be prosecuted for or litigated against in a court of law for the offense(s)
committed. Once initial court proceedings have begun, the statute of limitations shall cease
to apply, including during any appeals that may occur going forward.]

(b) The length of the statute of limitations shall be dependent on the type(s) of offense(s)
committed, henceforth defined in this legislation.

## SECTION 2.

The statute of limitations for all civil offenses to be pursued in civil court shall
be considered two (2) months.

(a) The period of limitation on civil affairs may be shortened or lengthened, should it be
desired and agreed upon by both parties and with the consent of the case judge.

## SECTION 3.

The statute of limitations for all non-civil offenses pursued in criminal court shall
be dependent on the type of offense.

(a) For all traffic infractions, offenses punishable only by citation, and all other offenses not
otherwise enumerated in this bill and not a misdemeanor or a felony, the statute of limitations
shall be considered fifteen (15) days.

considered sixty (60) days.

<sup>F2</sup> [(d) For those crimes defined as Class A or Class B felonies, the statute of limitations shall
be considered one hundred and eighty (180) days.]

(e) For those crimes considered “Crimes Against the Government Order” under Chapter 6 of
the Criminal Code 12, the statute of limitations shall not apply.

(f) For those crimes considered “Courts Only” under the Criminal Code Revision Act, the
statute of limitations shall not apply.

## SECTION 4.

In any case, the accused party (defendant) shall have the right to waive the
statute of limitations by which they are or would be protected on the offense(s) of which
they have been accused.

## SECTION 5.

Should any clause, subclause, or other section of this legislation be declared
