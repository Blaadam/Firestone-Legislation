officials, and patterns and/or practices of misconduct by government entities.

(c) Agents of this division shall have the general investigatory powers afforded to law
enforcement under state law and custom, including but not limited to the ability to acquire
testimony under oath, request warrants to acquire evidence as needed, compel questioning as
lawfully necessary, and secure evidence.

(d) The division and its agents shall have the authority to compel departmental records, policies,
logs, archives, and similar such evidence absolutely for an investigation.

<ul>
(d1) If any agency or employee asserts that any evidence requested by this division
pursuant to an investigation herein described is classified, the Attorney General shall
direct that such evidence be directed to their custody, where they may determine its
validity under classification law. If the Attorney General determines it is not legally
classified, they shall disclose it in full to the division. If it is legally classified, the Attorney
General shall act in accordance with classification law. That notwithstanding, classified
evidence may be used in an analysis of patterns and practices, and may be employed in a
compliance directive as plausible and necessary.
</ul>

## §9. Consent Directives

(a) Upon an investigation by the Justice Department division described herein, the Justice
Department shall be empowered to file an action (to be referred to as a Dandude’s filing) against
an offender agency/entity in the District Court to correct patterns and practices of misconduct.

(b) The state courts shall create special procedures for adjudicating a Dandude’s filing. They, at
minimum, must be adversarial in nature; allowing each side to present an argument and
evidence, the division must prove a pattern or practice (or multiple thereof) of misconduct by a
preponderance of the evidence, and if such patterns and practices are found, the court must hold
a hearing to allow the division to present a plan of corrective action for a consent directive for
which the offending agency shall have input.

(c) If a court finds a pattern or practice of misconduct exists, the court shall direct the division
described herein to create a plan of action to correct such patterns and practices via policy
changes, retraining, etc. This directive shall be directed to the department head of the
agency/entity, who shall be responsible for enforcement. This directive shall have a timeline of
implementation and evaluation, where the agency/entity shall have a set period of time to
implement changes. The court may take necessary action to enforce compliance with this
directive and its timeline should the agency/entity fail to comply; the Justice Department may
also take criminal action as relevant pursuant to this act. If the agency/entity complies with the
implementation stage, the division shall then conduct an evaluation of the agency with the
corrective action in place. The division shall report on its findings to the court. If the patterns and
practices have been fixed, the court shall find the corrective directive complete. If not, the parties
shall once again come together to amend the directive to further correct the issue. The court
shall be the final arbiter of success or failure of the directive.

(c1) The post-implementation evaluation shall encompass a secondary investigation into the type
of misconduct found as a pattern or practice originally, and if such patterns and practices have
ceased correlated with the changes in the directive, the implementation shall be a success. This
secondary investigation may make the same inquiries as the original to determine efficacy and
compliance.
