# Revised Contracts Act of 2023

An Act

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,

## SECTION I - ESTABLISHMENT & NULLIFICATION

(a) The Revised Contracts Act of 2023 shall be established.
(b) “[Contracts Act of 2019](https://trello.com/c/ElhdVCnN/2852-contracts-act-of-2019) ” shall be declared null and void.

## SECTION II - CONTRACT LAW

(a) A contract is a promise or set of promises, for breach of which the law gives remedy, or the
performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty. It is an agreement between two
or more parties creating obligations that are enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law.

## SECTION III - CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

(a) A contract shall only be legally binding should the following conditions be met;

<ul>
(i) The contract is agreed upon by all parties of the same agreement. This must be proven
objectively.<br/>

(ii) The contract must be expressed by a valid offer and acceptance. An offer shall be
construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the
circumstances. Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of
acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable amount of
time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.<br/>

(iii) The contract must have adequate consideration. Consideration is a promise,
performance, or forbearance, bargained by a promiser in exchange for their promise.<br/>

(iv) The contract must have adequate capacity. Capacity is the ability to satisfy the
elements required for someone to be in a binding contract. A person shall not be allowed
to enter a binding contract if the person; does not understand all provisions at the time of
the agreement; or is under duress or intimidation by anyone at the time of the agreement.
Should any of the aforementioned factors in Section III, sub-section iv be present, the
contract shall be declared null and void.<br/>

(v) The contract may not require any person, business, or entity to commit illegal
activities as described in relevant Firestone law.<br/>

(vi) The contract may not relieve any person of their rights guaranteed by the Firestone
Constitution.<br/>

(vii) The contract may not relieve any person of their rights guaranteed by statutes in
relevant Firestone law unless otherwise stated by the relevant statute. This clause shall
not prevent persons from conditionally or unconditionally waiving their right to pursue a
case in the courts for a specific incident.<br/>

(viii)
<sup>F2</sup> The contract, should it be written, must include an exit clause, which shall specify
the conditions and requirements for termination of the contract, and such requirements
shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved in the contract. Unless it provides
otherwise, a verbal contract may be exited by any party at any time, and any obligations
already met must be compensated, or it shall be a breach of contract.<br/>

(ix)
<sup>F1</sup> No contract may be unconscionable, or otherwise absurdly unreasonable or unfair
to one party. In determining the reasonableness of a contract, a court may consider the
adequacy of consideration, but consideration shall not be an absolute bar to
unconscionability.

</ul>

## SECTION IV - ENFORCEMENT

(a) This legislation shall be enforced in the Firestone court of law. The Firestone Court of law
may order specific performance from a party that breaches a contract.

## SECTION V - SEVERABILITY

(a) Should any provision of this legislation be found to be unconstitutional and struck down, the
rest shall retain amiability. This legislation shall go into immediate effect after meeting
Constitutional legislation requirements.
