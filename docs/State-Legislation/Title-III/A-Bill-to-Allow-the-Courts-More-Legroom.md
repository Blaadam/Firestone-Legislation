An Act<br/>
To establish a larger amount of realism in a regular Firestone courtroom.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,

## SECTION 1.

The term “motion” shall be defined as: a professional request articulated by one
party in the courtroom, be it directed to the opposing party, the judge, the courts, or the
case in itself.

<ul>
(a) The term “Firestone Courts” shall be defined as:

(b) The term “Firestone Department of Justice” shall be defined as:<br/>

(c) The term “presiding judge” shall be defined as: an approved and appropriate judicial
officer executing [his/her/their] duties; the judge within the Firestone Courts who is
in charge of a case.

</ul>

## SECTION 2.

<sup>F1</sup>
[The following motions shall be able to be used in Firestone Courts: motion to
dismiss, motion in limine, motion for nolle prosequi, motion for summary judgement,
motion to strike, motion for a directed verdict, motion for judgement notwithstanding the
verdict. Motions shall be directed to the presiding justice, and the presiding justice shall
notify the party which is not motioning (or moving) regarding the motion. The other party
shall have the ability to present his or her opposition (a statement against the motion) and
the justice shall decide whether to accept or reject the motion.]

<sup>F2</sup>
[(a) Motion to dismiss may be submitted by the defendant during or before the trial.
Motion to dismiss shall only be accepted if (1) there is no legal principle nor basis for the
matter (2) the court lacks jurisdiction in the matter (only in foreign matters). Upon
acceptance, the matter shall be dismissed immediately (with prejudice)]

<sup>F3</sup>
[(b) Motion in limine may be submitted by either parties during or before the trial. Motions
in limine shall require the Court to decide whether or not evidence presented should be
accepted and be heard by the jury. Motions in limine shall be accepted if the evidence
inflames the jury & leads them away from the legal basis & truth. Both the party which is
submitting the evidence and the opposition have the right to submit such motion. Motions
in limine may not be submitted in bench trials, and such evidence must be decided upon by
the presiding justice without a motion having to be submitted.]

<sup>F4</sup>
[(c) Motion for nolle prosequi may be submitted by the Department of Justice or any other
independent plaintiff in a suit, during or prior to trial. Motions for nolle prosequi shall be an
official statement from the plaintiff(s), wherein they decide to drop charges against the
defendant(s). A valid reasoning for this does not have to be presented in civil cases,
however, must be presented in criminal cases. Valid reasoning in criminal cases are (1) the
evidence lacks proving the defendant’s innocence (2) the prosecution believes that the
issue-at-hand is not valid and is caused due to issues that are unable to occur in real life
(this includes glitches) (3) any other reasoning deemed fit by the presiding justice and the
Department of Justice. Attempting or succeeding to bribe, coerce or otherwise force an
individual to drop charges shall be a misdemeanor charge of intimidating a party and shall
result in a jail time of no more than 1 hour in prison (this charge may not be enforced by
law enforcement).]

<sup>F5</sup>
[(d)Motion for summary judgement may be submitted by the defense in a criminal case or
either party in a civil case, prior to trial. Motions for summary judgement may only be accepted
if all of the following requirements are met: (1) the evidence provided proves beyond a
reasonable doubt in favor of the party motioning (2) there is no valid dispute regarding the
evidence (may be interpreted by the presiding justice) (3) there is no valid dispute regarding a
matter of law (4) any reasonable jury or presiding justice would agree with the party moving.
Upon acceptance, all proceedings are skipped and the case shall fall in favor of the party
moving. This may be appealed to a higher court only if valid evidence is provided that shows
even a somewhat valid dispute.]

<sup>F6</sup>
[(e) Motion to strike may be submitted by either parties during trial. Motions to strike shall
immediately order the jury or presiding justice to disregard evidence, testimony, speech or any
outbursts in the courtroom. Motions to strike may only be accepted if (1) the matter (evidence,
testimony, etc.) can, did or would inflame or otherwise prejudice the jury or presiding justice
from the truth (2) the matter is in blatant violation of common law evidentiary proceedings
(may be interpreted by the Chief Court Justice). ]

<sup>F7</sup>
[(f) Motion for directed verdict may be submitted by either parties during trial. Motions for
directed verdict have the same principles of motions for summary judgement, except that
they must be submitted during trial. See Section 2D.]

<sup>F8</sup>
[(g) Motion for judgement notwithstanding the verdict may only be submitted by the
defense, a maximum of (14) days after the verdict of a jury trial has been given. Motions for
judgement notwithstanding the verdict may only be submitted in the case of a jury trial, and
may only be submitted if the verdict is guilty. Motions for judgement notwithstanding the
verdict shall have the same principles of motions for directed verdict & motions for
summary judgement, except that they must be after the trial and must be in a jury trial.
Upon acceptance, motions for judgement notwithstanding the verdict shall overturn the
jury’s verdict of guilty to not-guilty. Among other reasons to motion for judgement
notwithstanding the verdict, the defense may make the motion based on the justness of the
law. If it is deemed through proper procedure that the law with which the defense has been
found guilty of violating is unjust and/or unconstitutional, the motion shall be approved and
the verdict overturned.’]

<sup>F9</sup>
[(h) Motions may be submitted in writing or orally, and (as stated in Section 2) must be
given a chance for opposition. A justice’s decision regarding a motion may be appealed to a
higher court with valid reasoning.]

<sup>F10</sup>
[(i) If a defendant intentionally leaves during a subpoenaed trial without permission from
a bailiff or the presiding justice, he or she may be held in contempt. Repeating this action
(2) or more times may result in the justice ruling in favor of the prosecution.]

## SECTION 3.

Motions may be further defined and established in other pieces of legislation.

## SECTION 4.

The courts have full authority to reinterpret/hinder the definition of any
plausible motions.

## SECTION 5.

If an attorney, adjudicator, or any other officer within the Firestone Department of
Justice or the Firestone Courts does not acknowledge any motions listed and defined above
(provided they meet all expectations and requirements), he/she/they are eligible and may be
recommended for a contempt of court charge.

## SECTION 6.

This legislation shall take effect upon its approval.

## SECTION 7.

All laws in conflict with this legislation are hereby declared null and void.
