# A Bill to Install Suspended Sentence Terms

An Act

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,

## SECTION 1.

A “suspended sentence” shall be defined as a court’s decision to delay the prison
term of convicted persons indefinitely given that the subject meets the conditions set by the
court.

## SECTION 2.

Any convicted person who receives a suspended sentence shall not be required to
serve the time allocated to that suspended sentence as long as (s)he continues to meet the
conditions set by the court.

## SECTION 3.

“Conditions set by the court” as it is relevant to suspended sentences may include:

<ul>
  <li>
    Not committing any further criminal acts
  </li>
  <li>
    Any other reasonable and just condition as set by the presiding judge
  </li>
</ul>

## SECTION 4.

A suspended sentence may be imposed on top of a normal sentence. For
instance, a judge may issue one hour of mandatory time under the custody of the
Department of Corrections followed by five hours of a suspended sentence which shall not
be required to be served unless conditions set by the court are violated. No court may issue
a combined time which surpasses the legal maximum for prison time of a particular charge
or as otherwise defined in law.

## SECTION 5.

In the event that a convicted person violates any of the conditional terms of his
or her suspended sentence as defined in Section 3 of this legislation, (s)he shall be required
to complete the entirety of their suspended prison time.

## SECTION 6.

The court has the ultimate discretion to determine for how long the conditions
set by the court must be met until the suspended sentence expires so long as that period
does not surpass three (3) months.

## SECTION 7.

The Firestone Courts shall be responsible for enforcing this legislation.
