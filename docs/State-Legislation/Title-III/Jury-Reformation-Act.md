# Jury Reformation Act

An Act<br/>
To reform and better protect jury proceedings..

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,

## SECTION 1.

(a) The Firestone Criminal Code shall be defined as this board established by this Act.

(b) A Bill to Institute Jury Reform shall be defined as this bill and shall be declared null
and void.

## SECTION 2.

(a) Judges and Justices are tasked with retaining and maintaining the database
established by Section 1 of A Bill to Institute Jury Reform to the best of their abilities
in accordance with this Act. “Juror’s records” created on the basis of A Bill to
Institute Jury Reform for jurors who served on a trial which concluded before this
Act’s enactment must be reasonably retained in line with the bill’s original purposes.

(b)

<ul>
1. The database must include a reasonably accurate juror record of each juror who
is serving or did serve on any trial or part of a trial which took place after this Act’s
enactment. Juror records must – insofar it is possible – include:

<ul>
  <li>
    Juror’s username;
  </li>
  <li>
    Case name;
  </li>
  <li>
    “Case number” if present;
  </li>
  <li>
    Date(s) of trial;
  </li>
  <li>
    Date(s) of deliberations; and
  </li>
  <li>
    Verdict(s) of case or whether or not the case was dismissed.
  </li>
</ul>

2. If the juror was head juror, this must be noted on the juror record. If the juror left
   before concluding deliberations, this and whether or not the juror was excused must
   be noted on the juror record. If the juror was dismissed before concluding
   deliberations, this and the reason for dismissal must be noted on the juror record.

</ul>

## SECTION 3.

(a) The database must be private and sealed from the general public. The following shall
be granted inherent access to the database:

<ul>
<li>
Judges and Justices;
</li>
<li>
The Attorney General; and
</li>
<li>
Anyone employed within the Department of Justice or the Bureau of Investigation
authorized to access the database by the Attorney General.
</li>
</ul>

(b) Judges and Justices may, if absolutely necessary, unseal and disclose juror records
and other parts of the database only if probable cause exists that such could prove
unlawful or unethical conduct.

## SECTION 4.

(a) The speech and conduct of any juror in deliberations which relates to the
deliberations must be private and sealed from the general public if the deliberations
commenced after this Act’s enactment. Only Judges and Justices – as well as other
entities or persons which out of practical necessity are given overwhelming viewing
rights – shall be granted inherent access to such. In deliberations, jurors must not
edit, delete, or tamper with any message; if such occurs, the respective Judge or
Justice must be informed and must take all means necessary to prevent further
dissemination of sealed speech or conduct.

(b) The Attorney General may receive information regarding speech or conduct of any
juror in deliberations which relates to the deliberations; such information and its
implications must be kept private. However, only a Judge or Justice – related or
unrelated to the case – may, if absolutely necessary, fully unseal and disclose speech
or conduct of a juror in deliberations which relates to the deliberations only if
probable cause exists that such could prove unlawful or unethical conduct. Special
consideration must be shown towards the identities of innocent jurors and the
broadness of unsealing.

## SECTION 5.

Chapter 6, Section 19 shall be established in the Firestone Criminal Code and shall
be titled “§19 - Unlawful Handling of Jury Information”.

(a) Chapter 6, Section 19 of the Firestone Criminal Code shall state:

disclosing, disseminating, or distributing:

<li>

relates to the deliberations if the deliberations commenced after the Jury
Reformation Act’s enactment to any person except to a Judge or Justice, a juror on
the same trial, or the Attorney General without compelling justification.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
(b) Chapter 6, Section 19 of the Firestone Criminal Code shall be classed as a Class B
