resolution for a proposed amendment to the current rules of procedure to be enacted
upon approval by the legislature. Justices DannyboyJurist, ElloNT, and cityuser voted
in favor of this amendment. Justice Wolf_RBX took no part in the decision.

## Section I: Amendment

1. Rule 10 of Civil Procedure shall be established and shall be named "Consent
   Directives".

2. Rule 10 of Civil Procedure shall state the following:

<ul>
  (A) The Department of Justice may file a Dandude's filing in the manner
  described in Rule 1 of Civil Procedure.<br/>

(B) The court shall obtain a pleading or pleadings from the defendant in the
manner described in Rule 2 of Civil Procedure.<br/>

(C) Either party may move in the manners recognised by Rule 6 of Civil
Procedure to the extent they are applicable during the adjudication of a
Dandude's filing, except the hearings described in this rule may not be skipped.<br/>

(D) After receiving the pleading or pleadings, the court shall hold a conference
consisting of:<br/>

  <ul>
    1. Confirming counsel for the parties and having them and the parties sworn
    to honesty;<br/>

    2. Discovery, in accordance with the Rules of Evidence;<br/>

    3. Any relevant motions.<br/>

  </ul>
  (E) After the conference concludes, the court shall hold a hearing to determine
  whether the pattern or practice of misconduct alleged by the Department of
  Justice exists. This hearing must be held even if the defendant makes a general
  admission in their pleadings. This hearing must include the following, but may
  otherwise be conducted as the Presiding Officer prescribes:<br/>
  <ul>
    1. Swearing in the parties and their counsel, unless already done;<br/>

    2. The Department of Justice shall present evidence and hear witnesses;<br/>

    3. The defendant may present evidence and hear witnesses;<br/>

    4. The Department of Justice may deliver their arguments;<br/>

    5. The defendant may deliver their arguments.<br/>

  </ul>
  (F) If the court finds that the Department of Justice has proven that the patterns
  or practices of misconduct alleged exist by a preponderance of the evidence, the
  court shall hold a hearing to determine corrective action. This hearing must
  include the following, but may otherwise be conducted as the Presiding Officer
  prescribes:<br/>
  <ul>
    1. Swearing in the parties and their counsel, unless already done;<br/>

    2. The Department of Justice shall be directed to create a plan of action to
    correct the patterns and practices of misconduct found to exist;<br/>

    3. The Department of Justice shall present this plan to the court;<br/>

    4. The defendant may give their views on the plan and suggest amendments;<br/>

    5. The court may give their views on the plan and approve it or require
    amendments to it.<br/>

  </ul>
  (G) Once a plan is approved by the Presiding Officer, the court shall issue a
  consent directive consistent with this plan.<br/>
  <ul>
    1. The consent directive shall be addressed to the head of the defendant
    agency or entity.<br/>

    2. The consent directive shall include a time limit to implement the changes
    described, which shall be no less than two (2) weeks.<br/>

    3. The consent directive shall include a timeline for when evaluation is
    performed.<br/>

    4. The court may issue court orders as necessary to affect compliance with
    the consent directive and its timeline.<br/>

  </ul>
  (H) After the changes described in the consent directive are implemented, the
  Department of Justice shall investigate and report to the court whether the
  patterns and practices of misconduct previously found to exist still do. The
  defendant may address the findings of the Department of Justice.<br/>

  (I) If the court is satisfied that the patterns and practices of misconduct have
  been corrected, the consent directive is complete. If not, the consent directive has
  failed and the court shall hold a new hearing pursuant to Rule 10(F) and may
  issue a new consent directive pursuant to Rule 10(G).

</ul>

## Section II: Enactment

1. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon passage through the special
   legislative procedures detailed by the Constitution.
