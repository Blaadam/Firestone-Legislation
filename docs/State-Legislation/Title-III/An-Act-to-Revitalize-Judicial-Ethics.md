## SECTION 2.

A Bill to Illegalize the Violation of Judicial Ethics shall be declared null and
void.

lawful functions prescribed by law shall not be applicable under this section.

## SECTION 6.

Judicial officers shall abide by the recusal regulations set forth in any and all
procedural rules for the judicial system.
