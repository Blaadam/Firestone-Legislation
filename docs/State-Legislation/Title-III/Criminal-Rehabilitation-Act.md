# Criminal Rehabilitation Act

An Act<br/>
The current NCLB program is extremely flawed. It doesn’t get the right people through,
overburdens the courts, and is poorly maintained. This Act will reform the program so it gives
criminals a proper way to get a fresh start.<br/>
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
Firestone in Congress assembled,

## SECTION 1.

(a) The Criminal Rehabilitation Program (the “CRP” or hereinafter referred to as “the Program”) shall be established.

(b) The Program shall be managed by the Board of Rehabilitation and Employment of
Criminals (the “BREC” or hereinafter referred to as “the Board”).

<ul>
1. The Board shall be chaired by the Attorney General who shall have administrative
   overview of the Board but equal voting powers as any other Board member.<br/>
2. The Board shall furthermore be composed of the Governor, the Department of Public
   Safety Secretary, the Peace Officer Standards and Training Director, and any other
   persons appointed by the Attorney General and confirmed by the Senate through a simple
   majority vote.<br/>
3. The Board shall be authorized to remove any appointed Board member through a
   supermajority (2⁄3 or more) vote of all Board members excluding the member which is
   being removed.<br/>
4. F5The Board shall be authorized to blacklist any person from the Program through a
   supermajority (2⁄3 or more) vote for any reason deemed plausible by the Board, or remove
   any participant of the Program through a simple majority (1⁄2 or more) vote if the person’s
   participation or a CRP Seal would be a potential threat to state security or if the participant
   fails to show effort in completing the Program or violates this Act. A blacklist may be
   removed through a simple majority vote at any time.<br/>
5. The Board shall have the power to further regulate and make more stringent the
   requirements of any phase or pathway established by this Act through a unanimous
   vote.<br/>
6. Any Board member which fails to vote within twenty-four hours of the vote being
   initiated shall constitute an abstain vote.<br/>
7. All votes, processes, and communications of the Board shall be made public information.
   A publicly accessible mode of viewing a participant’s progress and any other information
   relevant to the Program shall be created and maintained.
</ul>

## SECTION 2.

(a) Any person meeting all of the following requirements may enter the
Program:

<ul>
1. <sup>F1</sup>
   [Be convicted in a criminal court; or have more than fifty arrest records; or currently
   have any Public Safety Blacklist and/or any Peace Officer Standards and Training
   certification suspension or revocation.<br/>
2. Not have been denied or approved a CRP Seal after the Seal Vote more than once
   before; and<br/>
3. Not have been removed from the Program (other than through denial or approval of a
   CRP Seal) more than three times before; and<br/>
4. Not be lawfully blacklisted from the Program; and<br/>
5. Have waited at least twenty-eight days since any criminal court conviction or the
   issuance of any Public Safety Blacklist and/or any Peace Officer Standards and
   Training certification suspension or revocation. Also have waited at least fourteen
   days since any arrest.]
</ul>

(b) The requirements for entering the Program set in subsection (a) and its clauses shall remain
in effect during the participant’s entire stay in the Program. If any of the requirements are not met
during the participant’s stay, they shall be removed from the Program.

<sup>F2</sup> [(c) The only exceptions to this section shall be if the person is an informant to the Firestone
Bureau of Investigation, a person testifies to the Firestone Department of Justice, or testifies to
the Firestone Courts.]

## SECTION 3.

<sup>F3</sup> [(a) Participants must complete Phase 1 of the Program within 30 days of
entering the Program. This time may be extended a specified amount of time upon a simple
majority vote (1⁄2) of the Board]

<sup>F4</sup> [(b) In order for a participant to complete the law enforcement pathway, the participant must
complete Firestone Police Exploring orientation, and three hours of community service logs
(ride-alongs, explorer meetings, and any other activities approved by Firestone Police
Exploring) with Firestone Police Exploring. The Board may set regulations on which law
enforcement agencies may be shadowed as part of the ride-alongs.]

<ul>
1. In order for a participant to complete the law enforcement pathway, the participant
   must complete three hours of assigned shadowing (in-game observations and following
   of a patrol) of any law enforcement officer while they are conducting their duties. The
   Board shall decide the law enforcement agency and/or officer to be shadowed.<br>

2. In order for a participant to complete the public employee pathway, the participant shall
   be employed as a Public Employee for the duration of Phase 1 — with all respective
   authority, rights, and privileges attached except as restricted by this Act — of either the
   Department of Transportation or Department of Public Works (to be chosen by the
   participant). They must pass the required training which other Public Employees receive
   prior to being employed. After passing necessary training, the participant shall only
   conduct shifts with the absolute supervision of a supervisory employee. They must
   complete at least five policy-obedient shifts during Phase 1. At least sixty minutes of
   shifting shall be recorded by the supervisor or the participant and submitted to the Board.<br>

3. In order for a participant to complete the jurisprudential pathway, they must complete
and pass any and all legal education classes assigned by the Attorney General or the
Prominence College of Law (chosen by the Board). The Attorney General or the
Prominence College of Law will have full control over the length and content of the legal
education classes, as long as the classes would adequately prepare the participant to
pass the bar examination. Upon completion of the legal education classes, which shall
last no less than seven days, the participant shall complete and submit the bar
examination provided by the Board of Legal Examiners and Ethics (regardless of the
date or time bar examinations usually are open for submission) and shall have
completed Phase 1 if the participant showed reasonable effort towards passing the bar
examination — even if they did not pass.
</ul>

(c) Only upon successful completion of Phase 1 shall the participant continue to Phase 2;
otherwise, the participant shall be removed from the Program.

## SECTION 4.

(a) In order for a participant to complete Phase 2 of the Program, they must write
an essay to present to the Board. This essay shall include what they learned from their pathway
in Phase 1; how they will apply their experience to a future without crime; why they want to be
crime-free; and any other reasonable topics the Board wishes to be included in the essay to
ensure a fair judgement of the participant’s likelihood to reoffend. Participants shall have 7 days
to construct and submit this essay upon entering Phase 2.

(b) Upon submission of the essay, members of the Board may ask questions relevant to the
participant’s Program involvement and criminal history. The questioning period may last no
longer than 7 days unless longer questioning is further permitted by the participant.

(c) After the questioning period is completed, the participant shall have completed Phase 2 and
shall move to the Seal Vote.

## SECTION 5.

(a) The Board shall initiate a Seal Vote within 24 hours of the completion of Phase 2.

(b) With a 2⁄3 vote of the Board members, the CRP Seal shall be approved. Should less than 2⁄3 of
the Board vote in favor of the Seal Vote, the CRP Seal shall be denied.

(c) Participants which have their CRP Seal lawfully approved and have completed the Program
pursuant to this Act shall be removed from the Program and shall have: any and all criminal
convictions sealed; any and all arrests and citations sealed; and any Public Safety Blacklist
and/or Peace Officer Standards and Training certification suspension or revocation removed.

(d) Any sealment pursuant to subsection © involving arrests, citations, or court rulings shall be
enforced by the Firestone Courts. An automatic expungement shall be submitted and granted
for good cause upon a CRP Seal being approved. A ‘sealment’ refers to the removal of the stated
information from public viewing and removal of its legitimate status.

(e) Sealed information under this Act may not be prejudicially used against any participant by
any governmental agency or department for hiring, terminating, suspending, or otherwise
affecting the participant’s rapport. Violation hereof is subject to a participant’s right to challenge
the governmental agency or department’s action, whereas a competent court may overrule such
an action upon conclusion of a trial.

(f) Persons or entities which fail to properly enforce this Act are subject to civil litigation by any
standing party and any reasonable court injunction or order.

(g) Participants which have their CRP Seal denied shall be removed from the Program.
