pertains to allegations being investigated by the committee, both the committee and the

action so long as they acted reasonably and with a good faith belief that the information
being provided to the committee is reasonably relevant to their investigation.

of committee members. A vote to conclude an investigation shall also contain the
committee’s formal response and recommended action to the House of Representatives,
including any relevant evidence and testimony collected during committee proceedings.
