# An Act for the Establishment of a Permanent Seat of the Government of the State of Firestone

An Act To establish of a Permanent Seat of the Government of the State of Firestone<br/>
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
Firestone in Congress assembled,

## PREAMBLE

It is commonly known that the City of Prominence is the de facto capital of the
State of Firestone but this is not the case officially and in terms of legislation. Following
this, the County Affairs Committee has decided it would be adequate to officialise this into
law.

## SECTION 1. The City of Prominence and its respective jurisdiction will be officialised as the

Capital of the State of Firestone.

## SECTION 2. The City of Prominence will be recognised as the seat of state-level executive,

legislative, and judicial power within Firestone.

## SECTION 3. Upon passage through both chambers of Congress, and signature from the

Governor, this legislation will become law and become effective immediately.
