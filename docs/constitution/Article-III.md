All orders shall include: the seal of the relevant court, the case or proceeding to which the order is related, the type of order, the person(s) or organization(s) to which the order is directed, the conditions and requirements of the order, the time period for which the recipient has to comply (with a date and time to comply by), and the signature of the issuing authority.

III. When a party, witness, or other individual necessary to the execution of the judicial process refuses to comply with verbal or written summons by a judicial officer to attend any judicial proceeding, the relevant judicial official may issue a formal subpoena to compel the individual’s compliance under penalty of contempt. In a criminal case, should a defendant fail to comply with a subpoena, they may be punished with contempt and an attorney will be appointed to represent their interests in absentia. No subpoena shall be issued without at least seven day’s notice to comply before a penalty is issued. If the individual or organization that is subpoenaed is a party to a civil case, and they fail to comply with the subpoena to appear, the presiding officer shall—at their discretion—either enter a verdict in favor of the party in attendance or declare a mistrial. If an individual is on legitimate leave of absence, they cannot be penalized for failing to comply with a subpoena that contradicts the time period of that leave. Other good causes for failing to comply with a subpoena may be dictated by rules and statute.
