## Preamble

We, the People of the State of Firestone and our posterity, to ensure the foundation of a wholly perfect and unified state, commit ourselves to this Constitution as a beacon of hope for the liberty, security, and future successes of the People.

The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are the highest governing documents in the State of Firestone. Any and all documents, regulation, and standards passed by any City, County, Legislature, Court, or other governmental entity must not disobey the Constitution or Bill of Rights nor try to go above the Constitution or Bill of Rights.

No one is above the law, regardless of status within society: those who break any law as set out in this Constitution or the Bill of Rights shall be prosecuted accordingly.

The Constitution and Bill of Rights may be amended by Congress, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives, with a super-majority (2/3) vote from both chambers.

The Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the House, Chief Court Justice, and any other citizen chosen by any of the preceding individuals must establish and maintain an accurate reflection of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and their respective amendments through any publicly accessible means.
